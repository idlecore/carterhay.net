      <description>In 2023 I decided that I needed to improve my resume website. My previous website was extremely light-weight using only basic html/css and no javascript. It was built using the Pure CSS framework. The main problem with it was that it was ugly, and hard to update. The design of the website wasn&amp;rsquo;t good.
